Quiz 1 Graded -- see Submitty for your grades
-- to request a regrade, please stop by during any office hours
-- for regrade requests, please do these by Tues 6/11 !!!

Homework 2 has been posted -- focus on fork(), pipe(), IPC

Quiz 2 today -- yay!

======================================================================

requirements for IPC
-- synchronization
-- protocol

types of IPC
-- files (a process writes to a file; another process reads the file)
-- shared memory segments
-- message queues
-- pipe (a unidirectional communication channel)
-- socket-based communication (network programming)
-- exit status (from a terminating child process to the parent process)

   status & 0377  ==> 11111111  ==> 255
                8             2        10

======================================================================

A process is a "running program" or "program in execution"

Processes have a variety of states:


   RUNNING           READY                 WAITING (on I/O)
    STATE            STATE                  STATE

   +-----+                               +-----------------------+
   |     |     +--------------------+    |                 P2 P8 |
   | CPU | <== | P3 | P6 | P5 | ... |    |  I/O Subsystem   P13  |
   | P11 |     +--------------------+    |                       |
   +-----+                               +-----------------------+

 (a CPU burst is a set of assembly instructions that are executed by
   the CPU for a given process)

 (an I/O burst is one or more I/O operations for a given process)


 RUNNING STATE: process is actually using the CPU
                (i.e., executing its instructions)

 READY STATE: process is ready to use the CPU (idle in the ready queue)

 WAITING STATE: process is waiting for I/O operation(s) to complete


CPU Scheduling (a.k.a. Short-Term Scheduling)

-- The scheduling system enables one process to use the CPU
    while other processes are waiting in the ready queue to use
     the CPU (or waiting in the I/O subsystem)

-- The goals of CPU scheduling are to make efficient use of the CPU
    and to minimize the turnaround and wait times for each running process

    -- We also want to achieve "fairness" among all processes

             +-----------------------------------------------


What happens if the child process terminates before the
 parent process terminates?

  -- the child process returns an exit status and
      becomes a "zombie" or defunct process until its
       parent process acknowledges that the child process
        has terminated

  -- a SIGCHLD signal is also sent to the parent process,
      but this signal is ignored by default (see "man 7 signal")


What happens if the parent process terminates before the
 child process terminates?

  -- the child process is inherited by PID 1
      (which "kills" the zombie process)



     while ( 1 ) { fork(); }
